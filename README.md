# AI Platform

## Background

AI gig economy is coming. Many industries including Uber, DoorDash, Fiverr built an economy by relying on contingent workers, available on-demand. The great paradox of on-demand services is that they can be easily automated using artificial intelligence.

AI Automation is coming. Everything that can be automated should be automated. Artificial intelligence can be automated and should be automated. Consider the following:

- Where do AI systems come from? Research and development (R&D)
- What do AI systems do today? Perform tasks (i.e. provide services)
- What will AI systems be able to do? Automate human tasks (and more)
- What is R&D? Tasks to automate
- Where does AI R&D automation lead? Recursive technology improvement
- Where does that lead? AI services, which includes the service of developing new services

AI Explosion is coming. The AI explosion will be enabled by AI-driven AI developments. As AI technology is being recursively improved, new AI services and new AI tasks will be solved.

## About AI Platform

At [Produvia](https://produvia.com), we envision an AI Platform which aims to automate AI R&D Tasks. Our vision is to create machine learning models to solve various computer science tasks. We list a few examples of AI tasks below:

- semantic segmentation (computer visions)
- machine translation (natural language processing)
- word embeddings (methodology)
- recommendation systems (miscellaneous)
- speech recognition (speech)
- atari games (playing games)
- link prediction (graphs)
- time series classification (time series)
- audio generation (audio)
- visual odometry (robots)
- music information retrieval (music)
- dimensionality reduction (computer code)
- decision making (reasoning)
- knowledge graphs (knowledge base)
- adversarial attack (adversarial)

> "We need to standarize AI solutions by focusing on solving AI R&D tasks while developing machine learning models that are reusable and easily accessible by all."

**What are we doing?**

We are developing service-centered and technology-centered models. Service-centered models focus on completing distinct tasks while technology-centered models focus on functions. We believe advances in AI will enable incremental speedup and automation of human tasks. We are developing an AI platform to automate specific AI tasks in order to achieve full AI automation.

**Where are we today?**

Unautomated AI R&D tasks are human tasks. Automated AI R&D tasks are computer tasks solved using AI and machine learning.

**What is our approach?**

We are using an open-source machine learning lifecycle platform, [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/), to manage our AI tasks.

**Proposed Folder Structure:**

We propose to store machine learning models using the following folder structure:

`/tasks/area/task`

For example:

- [/tasks/computer-vision/image-classification](https://github.com/produvia/ai-platform/tree/master/tasks/computer-vision/image-classification)
- [/tasks/natural-language-processing/text-classification](https://github.com/produvia/ai-platform/tree/master/tasks/natural-language-processing/text-classification)

## Get Started

1. Clone this repo and review the `examples` folder.

2. When you want to contribute, solve one specific AI task using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) and issue a [new pull request](https://github.com/produvia/ai-platform/pulls).
